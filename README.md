# Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit

The Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit is a living, breathing document that contains all of our visual assets (components, iconography, color palettes, grids, templates, responsive behavior, etc). This document evolves and changes as we collaborate with partners and service teams.


## üìù Change Log
Contains release notes on current and previous versions of the Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit. 
* TBD


## :mag: Accessibility
All of the designs within the Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit meet the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility guidelines</a> and are compliant with <a href="https://www.section508.gov"/>Section 508</a> standards. If you choose to customize these designs, please make sure they continue to meet these requirements.


## üìö Getting Started

### Designers

* The Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit now uses the new typeface **IBM Plex**. It is open sourced and free to download from the [IBM GitHub repo](https://github.com/IBM/plex) 
* The Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit is currently available as a closed pilot. If you are an adopter that is migrating
to Carbon in your roadmap, you can reach out to us via Slack at `#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom`, or [open an issue here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-design-kit/issues).

* The Design Kit requires having the latest version of Figma installed.
* In a new Figma File, open the libraries overlay and enable `Carbon for IBM.com v2 BETA` from the list.
* Use the components and core visual styles to build out your design
* Updates to the Design Kit will be announced in your Figma files. Be sure to update to get latest versions of components and patterns.

### Developers: 
Carbon for IBM.com is available at our <a href="http://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom">Github repo</a>. Check out https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom for more information. 


## üåü Contributing

### Design
Follow the steps in our [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-design-kit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to contribute to the Carbon Design System.

### Code
For instructions on contributing to our IBM.com library please read our <a href="https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing docs</a>. 


## üíª Workflow

### Figma libraries
Our design kit is maintained inside Figma, and is accessible to internal IBM employees who have a Figma license. You can read more about enabling the Figma library on the [Carbon for IBM.com website](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/designing/design-kit).

### Plugins
The Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit now comes with the Sketch Palettes plugin which allows you to import Carbon specific palettes into your Sketch files. There are four Carbon palettes (a Carbon default palette and three data vis palettes) included with the Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit download. We also have a [wiki](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/wiki/Suggested-Sketch-Plugins) of suggested Sketch plugins to help make your design workflow more efficient.
