# Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit

The Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit is a living, breathing document that contains all of our visual assets (components, iconography, color palettes, grids, templates, responsive behavior, etc). This document evolves and changes as we collaborate with partners and service teams.


## üìù Change Log
Contains release notes on current and previous versions of the Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit. 
* TBD


## :mag: Accessibility
All of the designs within the Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit meet the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility guidelines</a> and are compliant with <a href="https://www.section508.gov"/>Section 508</a> standards. If you choose to customize these designs, please make sure they continue to meet these requirements.


## üìö Getting Started

### Designers

* The Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit now uses the new typeface **IBM Plex**. It is open sourced and free to download from the [IBM GitHub repo](https://github.com/IBM/plex) 
* The Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit is currently available as a closed pilot. If you are an adopter that is migrating
to Carbon in your roadmap, you can reach out to us via Slack at `#ibm-digital-design`, or [open an issue here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-design-kit/issues).

* The Design Kit requires having the latest version of <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> installed.
* Open the Design Kit file in Sketch
* Core visual styles, components, and templates are broken out into respective pages
* Use the components and core visual styles to build out your design
* Updates to the Design Kit will be posted in our change log, so check back frequently for changes!

### Developers: 
Our IBM.com Library is available at our <a href="http://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library">Github repo</a>. Website with developer guidelines is coming soon! 


## üåü Contributing

## üíª Workflow

### Sketch Libraries
Sketch Libraries is a new Sketch feature that allows designers to share Symbols across documents and easily update to the latest symbol changes. Read the [Sketch Libraries Overview wiki](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/wiki/Sketch-Libraries-Overview) to learn more about how to use and implement Sketch Libraries in your workflow.

### Plugins
The Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit now comes with the Sketch Palettes plugin which allows you to import Carbon specific palettes into your Sketch files. There are four Carbon palettes (a Carbon default palette and three data vis palettes) included with the Carbon for IBM.com Design Kit download. We also have a [wiki](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/wiki/Suggested-Sketch-Plugins) of suggested Sketch plugins to help make your design workflow more efficient.
