# Welcome!

The Carbon for IBM.com team is committed to maintaining consistent, quality guidelines. We welcome all feedback, designs, or ideas in order to produce the best possible experience for our users.

If you're interested in contributing please follow the guidelines below.

If you have any questions, reach out to us on Slack at `#ibm-digital-design`.

## Contributing process
### 1. Submit an issue
The easiest way for us to get an understanding of your needs is to open an issue. Follow our issue template (you'll see this when you go to open an issue) to ensure you are meeting the issue writing requirements. Screenshots are required when submitting a new pattern or component. A member of the Carbon for IBM.com team will respond to your issue with next steps or a follow up. 

**Not sure where to open an issue?**

The [carbon-for-ibm-design-kit repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-design-kit) is for Sketch and Craft bugs, as well as feedback on the Design Kit and component design.

The [carbon-for-ibm-website repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbom-for-ibm-website) is for Carbon for IBM.com website specific feedback or bugs.

**Not sure how to submit an issue?** 

It's not so bad, we promise! You can read a [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) on GitHub to get familiar with best practices.

### 2. Design review and sync
The easiest way to move forward in the design process is to set up an in-person or remote call with the Carbon for IBM.com team to go over your design work. We'll provide you with feedback on your proposal and what, if any, changes are needed before bringing them into the IBM.com Library. 

**What does it take for your design to pass Carbon for IBM.com's design review?**

The Carbon for IBM.com team will look for a few major things: 

### Accessible

* Is your design WCAG AA accessible? 
* Does your design pass [color contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) ratio? 
* Have you considered [keyboard tabbing](http://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility) and focus states?


### Componentized
Most components we accept into the global library need to work universally across products. 

* Have you tested this design for multiple use cases? It needs to be a pattern that all teams can utilize, and global enough to fit use cases for other teams. 
* Is there a similiar component in the library that already exists? 
* What are the advantages of this pattern over alternative patterns?



### Visual style and UX patterns

* Is your design consistent with our default visual [style](http://carbondesignsystem.com/themes) we have established for the core Carbon library? 
* Do your interaction patterns (hover, focus, motion, animations) match existing Carbon styles? 
* Does your design follow basic UX best practices? 
* Does your design promote clear language, correct grammar, and support globalization?

_Please make sure you have run through these design guidelines prior to the initial design review meeting. The Carbon for IBM.com team will be looking for the points mentioned above._ 


### 3. Roadmap
We'll work with your team to determine when your design will be implemented into IBM.com, and the logistics behind it. Development resources are greatly appreciated and welcomed. If your pattern is submitted without any code, please keep in mind it may be delayed from getting released into the IBM.com Library until we can fit it into our team sprint schedule.
